The Makers Academy Marketing Array ( **MAMA** ) have asked me to provide a game for them. Their daily grind is pretty tough and they need time to steam a little.

I have created _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ game for them so they can play on the web with the following user stories:

```sh
As a marketeer
So that I can see my name in lights
I would like to register my name before playing an online game

As a marketeer
So that I can enjoy myself away from the daily grind
I would like to be able to play rock/paper/scissors

As a marketeer
So that I can play even if I am alone
I would like to be able to play with a computerised opponent

As a marketeer
So that I can play when I have a friend(yay!)
I would like to be able to play with 2 players
```
